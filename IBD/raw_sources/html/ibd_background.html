				About 1000IBD
			</h1>
			<p>
				Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic complex disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Patients with IBD can experience a wide range of symptoms, but the pathophysiological mechanisms that cause these individual differences in clinical presentation remain largely unknown. In consequence, IBD is currently classified into subtypes using clinical characteristics. If we are to develop a more targeted treatment approach, molecular subtypes of IBD need to be discovered that can be used as new drug targets. To achieve this, we need multiple layers of molecular data generated from the same IBD patients.
			</p>
			<p>
				We initiated the 1000IBD project to prospectively follow more than 1000 IBD patients from the Northern provinces of the Netherlands. For these patients, we have collected a uniquely large number of phenotypes and generated multi-omics profiles. To date, 1,215 participants have been enrolled in the project and enrolment is on-going. Phenotype data collected for these participants includes information on dietary and environmental factors, drug responses, and adverse drug events. Genome information has been generated using genotyping (ImmunoChip, Global Screening Array and HumanExomeChip) and sequencing (whole exome sequencing and targeted resequencing of IBD susceptibility loci), transcriptome information generated using RNA-sequencing of intestinal biopsies and microbiome information generated using both sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and whole genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing.

			<p>
				All molecular data generated within the 1000IBD project will be shared on the European Genome-Phenome Archive (www.ega-archive.org, accession no: xxx). The first data release, on December 15th, 2017 contains basic phenotypes for 1,215 participants, genotypes of 473 participants, and gut microbiome data from stool samples generated by tag sequencing the 16S gene of 313 participants. Future releases will comprise many more additional phenotypes and -omics data layers. 1000IBD data can be used by other researchers as a replication cohort, a dataset to test new software tools, or a dataset for applying new statistical models.
